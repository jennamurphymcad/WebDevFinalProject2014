                        <p>As mentioned in the previous post: ‘Story Behind the Song: Ironiya’, the Soviet film ‘Ironiya Sudby’ was an inspiration for our song ‘Ironiya’.</p>
                        <p>Attached is a clip of a favorite song frmo the film: "If You Have No Aunt." (Can you hear the roots of our 'Ironiya"?</p>
                        <p>This first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEm0Eha4wyk">Bit of Vid</a> features a montage of still shots from the film including the infamous shower scene featuring our song's protagonist: Ippolit.</p>
                        <p>This second <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50CV0C4ox-k">Bit of Vid</a> shows the song in the movie with English subtitles.

                        <p>Posted on <span class="date">November 28, 2014</span> by <span class="author">Srazhalys</span></p>
                        <p>Our song ‘Ironiya’ was inspired by the Soviet film ‘Ironiya Sudby, ili S legkim parom’ from 1975.  The title translates roughly: ‘The Irony of Fate, or Enjoy Your Bath’.  It’s my understanding that this film holds a special place for people from the countries of the former Soviet Union somewhat akin (and probably more so) than Americans’ love for ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’.  I’m told ‘Ironiya Sudby’ is shown on TV every year at New Year’s.</p>

 

<p>Mentioning that it is a ‘Soviet film’ probably makes some of you think it is likely a communist propaganda film (as if that was the only kind of films the government would allow to be made).  But it really isn’t.  It’s a romantic comedy which involves the characters singing and playing some very charming music.  The lip-syncing during the songs is far from perfect, and the actors’ attempts to simulate playing the guitar are rather clumsy – but the songs are good none-the-less.</p>

 

<p>After watching the film, I went back with a guitar in hand and re-watched a couple scenes, trying to figure out the chord progressions.  I failed, but the progression for ‘Ironiya’ came out instead.  The chorus lyrics, a mix of English and Russian culminate with the line:  ‘I’ll be on my way…on my way out’.  I felt the song wanted to encapsulate the story of the film, but it wasn’t until several years later, when adding verse lyrics to the song, that I realized the song was actually not from the main protagonist’s perspective, but from that of the ousted lover: Ippolit (played wonderfully by Yuriy Yakolev.)</p>

                <p>Posted on <span class="date">November 16, 2014</span> by <span class="author">Srazhalys</span></p>
                <p>Ryan found this clip of guitarist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7M8L1rAUsI">Vittorio Camardese</a>.  If you want to cut to the chase go to minute 3:10 where he starts his rendition of “All of Me”.  Fantastic stuff – too bad the host interrupts him.</p>

 

				<p>We haven’t found a way to incorporate his playing style into our own songs yet, but give us time.

            		<h3 id="nov1114">From Chanson to Django</h3>
            		<p>Posted on <span class="date">November 11, 2014</span> by <span class="author">Srazhalys</span></p>
            		<p>In the previous post, the story behind our song ‘Chanson’ was told, but not why the French name was chosen.  Without purposely trying to, it seemed the song was attempting to capture the feel of the Gypsy Jazz recordings of Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grapelli.  Their music, centered in France in the 1930s, has given the Gypsy Jazz genre a kind of French stamp.  Thus the French word for song (chanson) was chosen for the title of our song.   Any fans of that music will recognize that what swing feel our song  ‘Chanson’ has is not the same as that of Reinhardt and Grapelli’s combo.  But ‘Chanson’ seemed to open a door to the wider possibilities of playing Gypsy Jazz.  What followed were our songs ‘Django’ (take a listen on our Home page), ‘Russian Lullaby’ (Irving Berlin tune we cover), and ‘Nuage #2′ (a song inspired by Django’s song “Nuages’) which all come more close to capturing the swing feel of Reinhardt and company.</p>

 

					<p>For those who know little or nothing of Django, he is a fascinating character well worth exploring.  One thing I will retell about him is that he lost the use of several fingers after a fire accident.  The fact that he didn’t quit playing and turned his limitation into an incredible technique has long been an inspiration to me when approaching instruments.  I find it liberating for my own playing to know I can find my own way even though I lack the proficiency of the maestros.</p>

 

					<p>Here’s a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpmOTGungnA">‘Minor Swing’</a> as played by Reinhardt and Grapelli with their combo.</p>
